# Profile Completeness Check - Analysis

## Issue Found: Two Different Endpoints with Different Criteria

### Endpoint 1: `/auth/verification-status` (Line 2159)
**Profile Completeness Check (Line 2217):**
```python
"completeProfile": {
    "met": has_bio and has_profile_pic and has_location, 
    "description": "Complete profile (bio, photo, location)"
}
```

**Required Fields:**
- ✅ Bio
- ✅ Profile Photo
- ✅ Location (city OR country)

---

### Endpoint 2: `/verification/status` (Line 2282)
**Profile Completeness Check (Line 2317-2323):**
```python
profile_complete = all([
    current_user.fullName,
    current_user.bio,
    current_user.profileImage,
    current_user.gender,
    current_user.age
])
```

**Required Fields:**
- ✅ Full Name
- ✅ Bio
- ✅ Profile Image
- ✅ Gender
- ✅ Age

**Missing:** Location is NOT checked in this endpoint!

---

## User's Experience
When the user added their bio, the profile showed as "complete" because:
- Full Name ✓ (filled during registration)
- Gender ✓ (filled during registration)
- Age ✓ (filled during registration)
- Profile Image ✓ (uploaded)
- **Bio ✓ (just added - this completed it)**

But if they check `/auth/verification-status`, it might still show incomplete if they don't have location!

---

## Recommendation
**Make both endpoints consistent** - they should check the same fields for profile completeness:
- Full Name
- Bio
- Profile Photo
- Location (City/Country)
- Gender
- Age
