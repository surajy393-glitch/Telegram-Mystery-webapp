# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FRONTEND (NotificationsPage.js): 1) Added 'started_following' type to getNotificationIcon() and getNotificationText() (lines 108-137), 2) Changed 'follow_request_accepted' text to 'accepted your follow request' (line 136), 3) Moved Follow back button to only show for 'started_following' type (line 227), removed from 'follow_request_accepted', 4) Made username CLICKABLE: imported useNavigate, added onClick handler with cursor-pointer and hover:underline styling (lines 193-201), navigates to /profile/{fromUserId}.

COMPREHENSIVE DUAL NOTIFICATION VERIFICATION: 1) ✅ Dual Notification Creation - Verified TWO separate notifications are created when follow request is accepted: requester receives 'follow_request_accepted' type, accepter receives 'started_following' type, 2) ✅ Requester Notification Structure - Confirmed requester gets correct notification with type='follow_request_accepted', proper fromUserId/fromUsername, NO follow back button (logic corrected), 3) ✅ Accepter Notification Structure - Confirmed accepter gets correct notification with type='started_following', proper fromUserId/fromUsername, WITH follow back button enabled, 4) ✅ Notification Cleanup - Verified original 'follow_request' notification is deleted and replaced with new notifications (tested with private users), 5) ✅ Multiple Scenarios - Successfully tested 3 simultaneous follow request acceptances, all created correct dual notifications. BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED: Lines 4207-4227 in server.py correctly implement the dual notification system with proper notification types and recipients. The corrected logic ensures requester gets confirmation without follow back option, while accepter gets notification with follow back capability. System is production-ready and working correctly."

        comment: "User reported that profile shows postsCount = 4 but posts grid is empty, only showing 'Posts Loading...' message. Root cause: fetchUserPosts being called with userId from URL params (could be username slug) instead of actual UUID from viewingUser object. Backend /api/users/{id}/posts endpoint expects UUID, returns empty array when given username. Frontend state userPosts remains empty [], triggering indefinite loading message. Response format also not robust - only checks response.data.posts, doesn't handle alternative formats."

        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE FIX APPLIED: 1) Created getAccountId() helper function to derive correct ID from user object (checks id, _id, user_id, tg_user_id) - same logic as 'About this account' modal. 2) Refactored useEffect: removed fetchUserPosts(userId) call from initial load, added separate useEffect that waits for viewingUser to load, then calls fetchUserPosts with derived accountId. 3) Updated auto-refresh useEffect to use getAccountId(viewingUser) instead of viewingUser.id. 4) Enhanced fetchUserPosts response handling: checks response.data.posts (array), response.data (array), or returns empty array - handles multiple API response formats. 5) Added postsLoading state (separate from main loading) to differentiate between 'actively loading' vs 'load failed'. 6) Updated UI: shows spinner during postsLoading, shows 'Unable to Load Posts' message if postsCount > 0 but userPosts empty after loading completes (with console hint). Frontend restarted (pid 4397). Now posts will load with correct UUID instead of username slug."

        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE FALLBACK SOLUTION APPLIED - BOTH FRONTEND & BACKEND: FRONTEND (ProfilePage.js): 1) fetchUserProfile: Added try-catch fallback - first attempts /users/{id}/profile (UUID), if fails tries /users/{id} (accepts username). Handles 401 errors with onLogout(). 2) fetchUserPosts: Now accepts (accountId, username) parameters. First tries /users/{accountId}/posts, if returns 0 posts but postsCount > 0, falls back to /users/{username}/posts. Handles 401 with onLogout(). 3) useEffect calls: Updated to pass both accountId AND username to fetchUserPosts(accountId, viewingUser.username). Auto-refresh also updated with same pattern. BACKEND (server.py line 4748): 4) Updated get_user_posts endpoint to accept both UUID and username: Changed user lookup to db.users.find_one({'$or': [{'id': userId}, {'username': userId}]}). 5) Posts query updated to fetch by both userId OR username: {'$and': [{'isArchived': False}, {'$or': [{'userId': user['id']}, {'username': user['username']}]}]}. This handles legacy posts saved with username slug. Both services restarted (backend pid 5203, frontend pid 5205). Now posts will load regardless of whether URL param is UUID or username, with automatic fallback chain."
