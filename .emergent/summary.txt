The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on resolving critical frontend and backend issues related to user profiles, particularly profile picture display, edit functionality, and post visibility, which were consistently breaking due to incorrect API URL construction and state management. Initially, the engineer tried to debug a verification pop-over and story username clickability, but user feedback shifted priorities to fixing registration, profile editing, and post display issues for private/public accounts. The core problem identified and repeatedly addressed was the use of  or hardcoded  as API/image URL prefixes, which failed in the deployed environment. The solution involved systematically refactoring all frontend files to use relative paths ( for API calls, direct  for images) and ensuring user state was correctly updated via  only during registration and profile edits. Several user accounts were repeatedly deleted and recreated to facilitate testing these fixes.

<product_requirements>
The application's core goal is to be an MVP dating app. Recent enhancements included a LuvHive Verified badge system with two-step verification (email/phone) and flexible pathways (High Engagement, Moderate Engagement, Community Contribution, Cross-Platform). A Founder Badge (crown icon) was introduced for the official LuvHive account. Other features included dynamic profile picture updates, an auto-refreshing feed, and infinite scroll for posts.

The primary problem being addressed in the trajectory was persistent issues with profile pictures not showing after registration, Edit Profile not working, incorrect post counts for private accounts, and a verification details pop-over not appearing. The pop-over was later replaced by an About this account section accessible via a 3-dot menu, displaying join date, country, and verification pathway. Registration and profile editing also needed to include a 'country' field.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the About this account dialog (replacing the verification pop-over) opens correctly and displays the gathered information (join date, country, verification pathway) on ProfilePage. (Currently, it was reported as not opening initially, and then the focus shifted to the profile picture and registration issues).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in an exhaustive debugging and refactoring process to resolve persistent issues with profile picture display, edit profile functionality, and general API call failures, especially after user registration or navigation to specific pages like Mystery Match. The root cause was identified as the inconsistent and incorrect construction of API and image URLs on the frontend, often relying on undefined environment variables (, , ) or hardcoded  as fallbacks. These issues caused API requests to fail (e.g., ), images not to load (e.g., ), and, critically, led to pages overwriting the  object in  with incomplete data, making the profile picture disappear and breaking core functionalities like Edit Profile.

The engineer systematically applied fixes across 24 frontend files (pages, components, and hooks), changing all API calls to use a relative  and ensuring all image  attributes use direct relative paths (e.g.,  instead of ). The  hook was updated to construct WebSocket URLs dynamically from . The  was updated to correctly call  to refresh the global user state after a successful update. The  test account was repeatedly deleted to facilitate clean registration tests. The very last action taken was to delete the  account one final time and prompt the user to clear  and re-test, with the expectation that all these issues are now resolved.
