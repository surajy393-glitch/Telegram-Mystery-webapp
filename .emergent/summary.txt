The AI engineer's work primarily focused on pivoting an existing Instagram-style web application and Telegram bot into a Mystery Match Lite dating platform, catering specifically to Indian cultural sensitivities. Initial efforts involved extensive code exploration, proposal generation, and iterative refinement based on user feedback, notably regarding privacy for joint families and payment via Telegram Stars. A significant portion of the trajectory was dedicated to troubleshooting and stabilizing the PostgreSQL database for the Telegram bot, including persistent storage and complete table schema import. Subsequently, the AI engineer began implementing the backend API for the Mystery Match feature, followed by initial frontend UI development. The current state has a functional backend, but the frontend integration and user experience are incomplete, with critical registration and loading issues needing immediate attention. The process highlighted the iterative nature of development and the importance of addressing foundational issues like data persistence.

The user initially had an Instagram-style web application () with an integrated Telegram bot, featuring posts, 24-hour stories, user registration, sign-in, and verification. The Telegram bot offered matching, chat, and premium features. The user wants to pivot this into a unique, safe, and legal dating/relationship platform, connected to the Telegram bot, with a future mobile app, and payments via Telegram Stars. The key problem is to differentiate from typical swipe-based apps while being privacy-conscious and culturally appropriate for the Indian market, particularly concerning joint family living. The AI engineer proposed a Mystery Match concept: blind matching where users progressively unlock profile details (age, city, blurred photo, interests, full photo) through message exchanges. Free users get 3 matches/day, 48-hour chat, and text-only. Premium users (250 Stars/month) get unlimited matches, instant profile reveal, advanced filters, voice messages, and a 7-day chat window, along with the existing Secret Chat feature.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating the new Mystery Match feature into the frontend. The backend API for Mystery Match has been successfully implemented, including endpoints for finding matches, sending messages, tracking unlocks, and managing match expiry. New PostgreSQL tables (, , , ) were created and applied to the database, bringing the total table count to 137.

On the frontend, the  file has been modified to route to the new  and  components, attempting to transform the UI from the previous Instagram-style to the new dating-focused design. A critical parsing error () in  was identified and fixed, allowing the frontend to compile successfully.

However, the application is currently in a broken state after registration: the user interface for registration remains in the old Instagram-style, and after attempting registration, the app gets stuck on a Loading... screen. The AI engineer is aware of these two immediate issues and was about to address them. The crucial data persistence issue for PostgreSQL was resolved by moving the data directory to , ensuring user data is retained across restarts.
