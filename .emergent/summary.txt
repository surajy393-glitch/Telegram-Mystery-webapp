The previous AI engineer initiated a full-stack LuvHive application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), handling initial features like user authentication, posts, and stories, using Telegram's  for media. Following a transfer of work, the current AI engineer was tasked with enhancing profile and chat features with AI integration and detailed profile management.

The engineer addressed explicit user requests to: 1) **Display profile pictures in comments**, correcting frontend logic to store and display the commenter's actual profile image. 2) **Enhance other users' profile pages**, refactoring routing and  to dynamically display individual profiles with placeholders for Vibe Compatibility and a 3-dot menu. Backend endpoints for fetching user profiles, blocking, hiding stories, and Vibe Compatibility (with OpenAI GPT-5 via ) were implemented. 3) **Implement a comprehensive Settings page**, creating  and an associated route. This evolved from a simple Public/Private Account toggle to a multi-category settings page (Privacy, Interaction, Notifications, Account Actions) and finally included Blocked Users management. Backend  models and API endpoints were continuously updated.

Backend and frontend automated tests were conducted at various stages, confirming functionality. The immediate task before this summary was the finalization and testing of the Blocked Users management within the settings page.

The LuvHive application is a Telegram-connected, Instagram-like social media platform for dating and anonymous chat. It features user content posting, 24-hour stories, and premium chat monetized via a Telegram bot. The UI uses a light pink/white theme. Core functionalities include user registration/login, media handling through Telegram CDN using  for scalability, and MongoDB for data storage.

Key Instagram-like features implemented include: user profile pages (own, saved, archived posts), followers/following system, interactive stories with 3-dot menu, comprehensive edit profile page, relative timestamp display for posts, 3-dot menu for *other users'* posts (save, unfollow, report), 3-dot menu for *own* posts (archive, hide like count, turn off commenting, edit caption, delete, pin), notifications, and working like/comment/share buttons.

Recent and current enhancements, based on explicit user requests, involve:
-   Displaying actual profile pictures in comments.
-   Replacing Send Spark with Vibe Compatibility on other user profiles, leveraging AI integration (OpenAI GPT-5).
-   Adding a 3-dot menu to other users' profile pages with Block, Report, Hide your story, Copy profile URL, and Share this profile options.
-   Developing a comprehensive, functional Settings page with Public/Private Account toggle, and sections for Privacy Controls, Interaction Preferences, Notifications, Account Actions, and Blocked Users management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing and testing comprehensive enhancements to the user's settings functionality. This involved:
1.  **Refining the Settings Page UI**: Based on user feedback, the  was modified to keep only one Public/Private Account toggle (the  setting) within the Privacy Controls section.
2.  **Implementing Blocked Users Management**: A new Blocked Users section was added to the , including a dialog for users to view and unblock previously blocked accounts. This involved adding necessary state, imports, and functionality (, ) to the frontend.
3.  **Backend Support for Blocked Users**: New backend endpoints (, ) were added to  to support fetching and managing blocked users.
4.  **Backend Model and API Updates**: The  model and the  endpoint in  were updated to remove the redundant  field and to include  in the user's profile data. The  endpoint was also adjusted to reflect these changes.

The backend changes were tested using , which confirmed that the updated settings page, including the blocked user management and the refined privacy toggle, is fully functional. The AI engineer was in the process of generating a final summary of these recent improvements.
