The AI engineer has progressively built and refined a full-stack dating application. The initial phase focused on critical bug fixes, including a  in , UI overflow issues, and incorrect navigation post-registration and edit profile. Significant effort was then dedicated to implementing new features such as a Vibe Compatibility System with personality questions during registration and a comprehensive private account/follow request mechanism. The work involved extensive debugging across both frontend (React with Tailwind CSS) and backend (FastAPI with MongoDB), iteratively addressing UI glitches, API contract mismatches, and data persistence issues. The latest work involves building a 3-dot menu for posts, a task currently in progress.

The user tasked the AI engineer with improving and expanding an existing full-stack dating application.
1.  **Initial Bug Fixes:**
    *   Resolve a  in  (duplicate  declaration).
    *   Fix UI text overflow (e.g., Relationship button text) on .
    *   Address poor text visibility on the  Step 3 UI.
    *   Correct post-registration navigation: Redirect from  to .
    *   Fix Edit Profile navigation redirecting to the main page instead of , and ensure profile picture updates persist.
    *   Ensure all profile pictures (top-right avatar, post DPs, story viewer DPs, comment DPs) are visible on .

2.  **New Feature Development:**
    *   **Vibe Compatibility System:** Implement an 8-question personality quiz during registration (Step 3). Calculate compatibility based on interests (30%) and personality (70%), displaying it after 30 chat messages. The component should be compact and renamed Vibe Check.
    *   **Private Account & Follow Request System:**
        *   If an account is private, follow requests should be sent, not instantly accepted.
        *   The follow button should change to Requested and allow cancellation.
        *   Private account posts should be hidden, displaying a This account is private message.
        *   Implement notifications for follow requests with Confirm and Delete actions.
        *   Ensure notification persistence (not disappearing upon navigation) and proper removal after action.

3.  **UI/Functionality Enhancements:**
    *   Remove Chat button from search results, only keeping Follow.
    *   Ensure Follow button functionality works consistently across search and profile pages.
    *   Fix Premium Chat button overflow on the Profile Page.
    *   Make settings toggles on  persist changes to the backend.
    *   Correctly display posts, followers, and following counts on  and .
    *   Make follower/following counts clickable to open lists of users.
    *   Implement a 3-dot menu on other users' posts with options for Follow/Unfollow, Mute User, Save, and Report (last task initiated).
