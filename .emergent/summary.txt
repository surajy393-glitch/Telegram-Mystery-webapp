The trajectory chronicles an iterative debugging process, initially tackling  and auto-logout issues. Following a database migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, the focus shifted dramatically to resolving numerous post-migration problems: Account Disabled, User not found, search failures, profile loading errors, and critically, the inability to upload, display, edit, and delete posts and stories. The AI engineer, guided by user videos and , systematically addressed schema mismatches in PostgreSQL, translated MongoDB-specific queries in , and fixed data type inconsistencies (string vs. integer IDs) across various backend endpoints in  and . Frontend components like  and  were also updated for correct token handling and API call prefixes. The most recent efforts concentrated on ensuring captions display correctly on posts and resolving UI layout issues for post details, indicating a transition from core functionality fixes to UI/UX refinement post-migration.

The LuvHive application is an MVP dating platform with premium membership tiers (4 types via Telegram Stars) and accurate premium status synchronization. Key features include displaying LuvHive Verified status based on 6 criteria, friction-free user registration (Name, Username, Email/Mobile, Password, Age, Gender, City, Country, Interests mandatory; Profile Photo/Bio optional), and correct persistence of all profile data, especially pictures and location. A critical migration from fragmented MongoDB/PostgreSQL to a unified PostgreSQL database introduced  and automatic logout issues, which were initially addressed by centralizing authentication logic and token storage. Subsequent issues revolved around account access, search functionality, profile editing, and the core social features of posting and viewing stories/posts, including correct display of captions and proper authorization for delete/archive actions, all stemming from schema and query translation inconsistencies post-migration.

-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
-   **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT,  (custom utility),  interceptors, centralized token handling.
-   **Database Migration**: MongoDB to PostgreSQL,  (for PostgreSQL query translation).
-   **Environment Management**: Kubernetes, Supervisor,  files.
-   **Data Type Consistency**: Explicit string/integer casting for user and post IDs.
-   **JSON Serialization**: Handling JSON strings for list/dict fields in database.

-   : The main FastAPI backend. Heavily modified to fix PostgreSQL schema mismatches, implement robust ID handling (string/integer coercion) for posts/stories, normalize likes/comments from JSON strings to lists, and consolidate duplicate API endpoints. Critical for authentication, post/story creation/deletion, and profile management.
-   : Handles social interactions. Modified to ensure  and  are saved correctly during story creation and to support the  field for posts. Previously had issues with content vs caption field names.
-   : A compatibility layer for PostgreSQL, translating MongoDB-like queries. Extensively modified to handle complex MongoDB query operators (, , , , ),  method, and  for PostgreSQL. Also updated  and  to handle ID conversions and dynamic column mappings.
-   : Centralized authentication client. , , and  were refactored to handle generic and Telegram-scoped tokens, ensuring consistent token storage and  error handling.
-   : User profile editing page. Fixed to correctly define , use  for API calls with the  prefix, and ensure the  field persists and displays correctly by updating model definitions in the backend.
-   : User's profile display page. Updated to correctly import and use  to avoid .
-   : Main content feed. Modified to correctly fetch and display stories by separating the current user's story () from others and normalizing  to prevent black screens and duplicate story circles.
-   : Examined to understand the expected full PostgreSQL schema.
-   : A dynamically created SQL script used to add missing columns and tables to the PostgreSQL database based on schema analysis.
-   : Another dynamically created SQL script to align  and  tables with application's expected fields.

-   **Frontend UI/Layout Fix for Post Caption**: The user reported that the caption appears below the username (Luvsociety) instead of beside it (like saraalikhan95 [caption]). This is a frontend layout issue.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on fixing a display issue related to post captions. The user reported that while captions were now appearing, their layout was incorrect: luvsociety upar bhi dikh raha and neecha bhi dikh raha caption ke sath luvsociety upar wala hi dikhna chaiya and uske side main caption dikhna chaiya. This was accompanied by a screenshot demonstrating the incorrect layout. The AI engineer acknowledged this, stating, Bilkul samajh gaya! Caption aa raha hai lekin layout galat hai. Instagram jaisa layout chahiye jahan username aur caption ek hi line me ho. Main frontend fix karta hu. This indicates a shift from backend data persistence and API logic to frontend rendering and styling. The previous efforts had successfully ensured captions were being retrieved and sent by the backend. The next step identified was to modify the frontend to correct this visual presentation.

<optional_next_step>
Adjust frontend (likely in  or a post component) to display the post's username and caption on the same line.
