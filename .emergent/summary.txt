The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a full-stack LuvHive web application, incrementally adding features based on user requests. The core architecture uses React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. A key architectural decision was adopting Telegram's  for media storage to handle large user bases, avoiding direct server storage.

Initial development focused on foundational elements: landing page, user registration/login, and basic post/story functionality. Debugging included resolving a  version conflict and ensuring correct JWT secret handling. Frontend UI/UX prioritized Instagram-like aesthetics using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components. Subsequent iterations added complex social features: user profiles, followers/following, saved posts, interactive story viewing with a 3-dot menu (delete, save, copy, share), a comprehensive edit profile page (with username change restrictions), and a notification system. Timestamp display for posts was refined to be relative and timezone-accurate. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, including fixing the like/comment functionality and adding a 3-dot menu for posts (save, unfollow, report). The current task involves further enhancing profile and chat features with AI integration and more detailed profile management options.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the comment and profile interaction features. The last task completed was addressing the user's report that the comment functionality wasn't working. The AI implemented a comment dialog with an input field and submit handler in . The screenshot taken after this change (Chat Message 310) showed the comment dialog successfully opened, allowing a user to type and submit comments. However, the user then reported that the comments were not displaying the profile pictures (only showing an initial) and requested further enhancements to the profile page interaction, specifically:

-   Showing actual profile pictures in comments.
-   Replacing Send Spark on other user profiles with Vibe compatibility, implying AI integration.
-   Adding a 3-dot menu to other users' profile pages with actions like Block, Report, Hide your story, Copy profile URL, and Share this profile.

The previous AI engineer acknowledged this request and stated: Bilkul bhai! Sab features add kar deta hoon - profile pic in comments, AI vibe compatibility, aur 3-dot menu with all options! ðŸš€ First, let me fix comment display to show profile pictures: indicating the immediate next step would be updating the frontend to fetch and display profile pictures for comments.
