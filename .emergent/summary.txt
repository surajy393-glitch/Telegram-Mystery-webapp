The AI engineer's work trajectory involved a challenging journey from initial feature implementation and bug fixes to a major architectural overhaul. Starting with implementing multi-tier Telegram Stars premium payments, the work was plagued by persistent  errors, stemming from  variable interpretation and incorrect  API usage, eventually resolved by explicitly handling URLs and slugs as per Telegram's documentation. A significant issue was the shared  in Telegram Mini Apps, causing user conflicts, which necessitated refactoring token management with -specific keys.

Subsequent debugging revealed inconsistencies in premium status syncing due to a misconfigured MongoDB database name and the need for automatic Telegram ID linking for email-registered users. The  status presented complex logic errors, requiring multiple iterations of backend and frontend fixes for criteria calculation and display. Ultimately, recurring database confusion and inconsistencies led to the critical decision to migrate the entire application from a dual MongoDB/PostgreSQL setup to a unified PostgreSQL database, which is the current, ongoing, and most substantial task.

The application, an MVP dating app, requires a LuvHive Verified system, dynamic profile updates, and social features. The AI engineer was tasked with:
1.  Implementing 4 premium membership tiers (1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months) via Telegram Stars, integrated into , with correct invoice generation and payment handling (inline in Telegram Mini App, fallback to bot).
2.  Ensuring premium status correctly syncs between the Telegram bot (PostgreSQL) and the webapp (MongoDB, eventually PostgreSQL).
3.  Resolving  conflicts in Telegram Mini Apps, allowing distinct user sessions across multiple Telegram accounts.
4.  Correcting  status display: 6 mandatory criteria (Email/Phone Verified, Complete Profile, Personality Quiz, No Violations, 45 Days), with conditional logic for email/phone, dynamic violation counts, and accurate percentage calculation.
5.  Fixing registration failures, including: updating to the correct backend endpoint, handling , ensuring all user fields are captured, and correctly processing image uploads and JSON responses.
6.  Consolidating the database from a fragmented MongoDB (webapp) and PostgreSQL (bot) setup to a single, unified PostgreSQL database to eliminate data inconsistencies and improve reliability.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a major architectural shift: migrating the entire application from a dual MongoDB/PostgreSQL database setup to a unified PostgreSQL database. This decision was driven by persistent data inconsistencies, premium status synchronization issues, and registration failures stemming from a messy database environment.

The current work has progressed to the initial stages of this migration. The  script has been successfully executed, transferring the existing MongoDB user data (specifically the Luvhive user and other relevant data) into the PostgreSQL database. The complete PostgreSQL schema for the application has been defined and applied via , creating all necessary tables like , , , , , and . Crucially, the Luvhive user's premium and verified status have been manually updated and confirmed within the new PostgreSQL structure.

The next, and most substantial, phase of this migration – **rewriting the entire backend () to use the PostgreSQL database exclusively** – has just begun. Dependencies like  and  have been installed and added to . A new helper module, , has been created to encapsulate PostgreSQL interaction logic. The AI engineer has started the process of modifying  to integrate these PostgreSQL components, signaling the beginning of a comprehensive backend rewrite.
