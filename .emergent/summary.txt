The previous AI engineer developed the initial LuvHive full-stack application. The current engineer was initially tasked with improving profile, chat, and settings features, including displaying profile pictures in comments, enhancing user profiles with AI Vibe Compatibility, and creating a comprehensive settings page with Blocked Users management. All these initial tasks were successfully completed and thoroughly tested.

Subsequently, the user requested to replace the discover functionality with a search feature. The engineer implemented backend search endpoints for users, posts, and hashtags, created a dedicated frontend , and updated navigation. User feedback then highlighted issues with clickable hashtags (which were copying text instead of navigating) and the trending users section. These were fixed by introducing a  component for proper navigation and removing redundant trending user displays.

Further user feedback pointed out a non-functional Follow button and inaccurate search results for users. Troubleshooting identified duplicate usernames (due to trailing spaces) and incorrect  logic in the backend. These were resolved by implementing robust username validation (trimming whitespace) in registration/login, manually cleaning database duplicates, correcting  logic, and enhancing the search algorithm for better accuracy and case-insensitivity. Performance was addressed with optimistic UI updates for follow actions, debounced search, loading skeletons, lazy image loading, caching, database indexing, response compression, and pagination.

Finally, the user inquired about converting the web app to a mobile app and integrating Telegram payments/login. The engineer recommended a Telegram-first authentication strategy with email backup, then initiated a React Native conversion, setting up the basic mobile app structure and implementing Telegram authentication and forgot password functionality in the backend. The immediate task before this summary is to integrate these Telegram authentication and forgot password features into the existing **web app**'s  and .

LuvHive is a Telegram-integrated, Instagram-like social media platform focused on dating and anonymous chat. It supports user posts, 24-hour stories, and premium chat monetized via a Telegram bot, all within a light pink/white UI. Core features include user authentication, media handling via Telegram CDN (using ), and MongoDB data storage. Implemented Instagram-like functionalities encompass user profiles (own, saved, archived posts), follower/following systems, interactive stories, comprehensive profile editing, timestamped posts, and various 3-dot menus for posts (save, unfollow, report, archive, hide likes, turn off comments, edit, delete, pin) and notifications. Recent enhancements included displaying profile pictures in comments, replacing Send Spark with Vibe Compatibility on other user profiles using OpenAI GPT-5, and adding a 3-dot menu to other user profiles with Block, Report, Hide your story, Copy profile URL, and Share this profile. A comprehensive Settings page with privacy, interaction, notifications, account actions, and blocked user management was also developed.
The user's current explicit requests involve:
1.  Replacing the discover page with a search functionality for public content (users, posts, hashtags).
2.  Making hashtags clickable in posts and search results, navigating to filtered search results.
3.  Ensuring the Follow button works correctly and provides immediate feedback.
4.  Improving search accuracy to show correct user profiles (especially with similar names).
5.  Optimizing app performance to reduce loading times and improve responsiveness.
6.  Converting the web app to a mobile app, specifically integrating Telegram-first authentication and forgot password functionality, considering Telegram Stars for payments, and addressing platform risks.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback that the Telegram login and forgot password features, recently implemented in the React Native mobile app backend, were not visible in the existing **web app**. The user had provided screenshots showing the web app's login/registration pages, which lacked these new functionalities.

The AI engineer acknowledged this and began integrating the Telegram-first authentication system into the **web app's frontend**.
The  () has been modified to:
1.  Manage a  state for a dialog.
2.  Include , , and  functions to manage authentication flows.
3.  Render a Telegram login button and a Forgot Password link in the UI.
4.  Integrate an  component for the forgot password feature, which allows users to request a password reset link via email.

The last action recorded was the engineer stating the intention to update the  to include the email field and Telegram registration, which is the immediate next step.
