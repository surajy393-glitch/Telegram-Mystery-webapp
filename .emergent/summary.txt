The AI engineer's trajectory involved a comprehensive set of fixes and feature additions for a social dating application, spanning both frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI, MongoDB) components. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes related to post loading, media display, privacy, and user profile interactions. This included standardizing media URL resolution, rectifying backend data handling for posts, and enhancing profile display logic to correctly show follow status and About dialogs.

Subsequently, the work shifted to refining the social interaction flow, specifically implementing a nuanced Follow back notification system and making follower/following lists clickable with dynamic follow buttons. A major strategic decision, advised by the AI engineer and confirmed by the user, was to remove the Mystery Match feature from the web app, positioning the Telegram bot as the primary platform for anonymous matching. The final, ongoing phase concentrated on integrating Telegram Stars for premium membership purchases, which involved complex debugging of invoice slugs, API calls, and ensuring cross-database (PostgreSQL for bot, MongoDB for webapp) synchronization of premium status, culminating in the identification of an invalid invoice slug as the immediate blocking issue.

The application is an MVP dating app with LuvHive Verified badges, Founder Badge, dynamic profile picture updates, auto-refreshing feeds, and infinite scroll. The AI engineer was tasked with resolving several critical issues and implementing new social features:

1.  **About this account Dialog:** Ensure this dialog correctly displays join date, country, and verification pathway.
2.  **Profile Picture Display:** Fix unreliable display of profile pictures post-registration.
3.  **Edit Profile Functionality:** Resolve intermittent failures in profile editing.
4.  **User  field:** Integrate into registration and profile editing.
5.  **Invalid token Errors:** Fix authentication issues blocking access to features.
6.  ** Status:** Ensure correct reflection post-registration.
7.  **Posts Loading and Display:** Resolve issues with posts not showing or images being broken, due to incorrect user IDs, backend filtering,  type errors, URL prefix mismatches, and improper Telegram media handling. Also, fix 401 errors on .
8.  **Private Profile Post Visibility:** Enforce stricter privacy rules to hide posts from non-owners.
9.  **Follow Notification and Follow back Button:** Implement a notification for the requester when a follow request is accepted, showing accepted your follow request (no Follow back button), and for the accepter, started following you with a Follow back button (if not already following).
10. **Clickable Usernames in Notifications:** Make usernames in notifications clickable to navigate to their profile.
11. **Follow back Button on ProfilePage:** If a user views a profile of someone who follows them (but they don't follow back), the button should display Follow back.
12. **Clickable Followers/Following Counts:** Make follower/following counts clickable to open a dialog showing the list of users, with privacy checks (public profiles show list, private do not).
13. **Follow Buttons in Followers/Following Dialog:** Within the dialog, each user in the list should have a dynamic button showing Follow, Follow back, Following, or Requested based on the current user's relationship with them.
14. **Requested Status for Pending Follows:** Show Requested button if a follow request is pending.
15. **Conditional Notification Creation:** The started following you notification with a Follow back button should only be created if the accepter does not already follow the requester.
16. **Remove Mystery Match Feature:** Remove all webapp UI and backend endpoints related to Mystery Match, ensuring no impact on other features or existing user data.
17. **Add Premium Membership CTA:** Integrate a Premium Membership section in  that allows users to purchase premium via Telegram Stars (preferably inline in Telegram Mini App, with fallback to bot).
18. **Telegram Bot Integration:** Properly start and configure the Telegram bot, including handling payment errors, correctly parsing payment durations, and removing old commands.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively debugging a critical issue with Telegram Stars premium payment integration. The Buy Premium with Stars button in the webapp's  was consistently redirecting users to the Telegram bot instead of opening the inline Stars payment interface, even when accessed from within the Telegram Mini App.

Initial investigations confirmed that  was correctly set in  and the  function in  was designed to use . To diagnose the redirection, extensive console logging was added to .

The latest user feedback provided a screenshot of the console output, which clearly showed the error: **Invoice url is invalid**. This indicates that the  value, which was previously generated by the  script in the bot and used in the frontend's , is not recognized as a valid invoice slug by Telegram's  API.

The current state is that the root cause for the payment redirection is identified as an invalid invoice slug. The webapp's code for handling the  call and its fallbacks is robust, but the input (the slug) itself is incorrect.

<optional_next_step>
Recreate the Telegram Stars invoice in the bot and update the webapp with the new, valid invoice URL.
