The trajectory details an extensive debugging process for the LuvHive application following a critical migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. Initially, the focus was on  and general post-migration errors like Account Disabled. The core of the work revolved around resolving data type inconsistencies (string vs. integer IDs), schema mismatches, and translating MongoDB-specific queries within . Iterative fixes were applied to backend files (, ) and frontend components (, ) to ensure correct display of posts, stories, and especially captions. A persistent challenge involved the comment functionality, repeatedly failing due to  operator incompatibility with PostgreSQL and  field type mismatches, requiring multiple calls to the  and detailed user-provided analyses to resolve. The process highlighted the complexity of database migration and the need for meticulous data and query handling.

<product_requirements>
The LuvHive application is an MVP dating platform with premium tiers, LuvHive Verified status based on six criteria, and a registration process requiring Name, Username, Email/Mobile, Password, Age, Gender, City, Country, and Interests. Profile data, including pictures and location, must persist correctly. A crucial migration from a fragmented MongoDB/PostgreSQL setup to a unified PostgreSQL database introduced widespread issues: , auto-logout, account access problems, search failures, profile editing errors, and critically, failures in core social features like posting and viewing stories/posts. The primary ongoing goal is to ensure correct display of captions, proper authorization for delete/archive actions, and fully functional comment sections, all stemming from schema, ID handling, and query translation inconsistencies post-migration.

-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
-   **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT, ,  interceptors, centralized token handling.
-   **Database Migration**: MongoDB to PostgreSQL,  (query translation).
-   **Data Type Consistency**: Explicit string/integer casting for IDs (, ),  objects vs. ISO strings.
-   **JSON Serialization**: Handling JSON strings for list/dict fields (, ) in PostgreSQL.
-   **Environment Management**: Kubernetes, Supervisor,  files.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main FastAPI backend. Heavily modified to fix PostgreSQL schema mismatches, implement ID handling (string/integer coercion), normalize likes/comments from JSON strings, and consolidate duplicate API endpoints (, caption editing). Important for authentication, post/story management, and profile actions. Changes included adding  helper, fixing , , removing duplicate  endpoints, and fixing , , , ,  for ID coercion. A duplicate comment endpoint was commented out.
-   : Handles social interactions (posts, stories, comments, likes). Modified to ensure  and  are saved correctly, support  field, and address  vs. auto-increment ID inconsistencies. Critical changes involved:
    -   : Removed UUID generation, now returns database-generated ID as string.
    -   : Removed UUID generation.
    -   , : Added integer conversion for  and  parameters.
    -   : Implemented robust parsing for / (from JSON strings), removed duplicates, and provided  fallback. Corrected  and  calculations.
    -   Added  endpoint for unified data structure (counts, ).
    -   : Modified  to use fetch-append- pattern instead of  due to PostgreSQL incompatibility.
    -   : Made robust to handle string  values by converting them to  objects and setting default UTC timezone.
-   : Compatibility layer for PostgreSQL. Modified to handle MongoDB query operators and methods (, , , , , , , , ) and ID conversions. Identified as the source of  operator incompatibility for comment updates.
-   : Main content feed. Modified to correct post caption layout (username and caption on the same line, Instagram-style) and to use  instead of .
-   : User's profile display page. Initially showing correct caption layout but later found to have duplicate username issues. Extensive modifications to fix:
    -   API base URL: Changed from  to .
    -   : Updated to use the new backend endpoint.
    -   : Unified / logic to a single  endpoint.
    -   : Sent  field and  as .
    -    / : Corrected endpoints and parameter names.
    -    / : Updated field names for consistency with backend  / .

-   **Verify Comment Functionality**: Confirm that comments can be successfully added and fetched on the Post Detail Page without errors or incorrect counts, following the latest  fix.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into resolving persistent issues with the comment functionality, particularly on the Post Detail Page. The user reported that comments failed to add (showing Failed to add comment alert) and failed to fetch (500 errors in console), despite comments sometimes being successfully saved in the backend. This was a recurring problem, intensified by the MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration.

Through multiple iterations and repeated calls to the  (totaling 9 calls over several user reports), several root causes were identified:
1.  **MongoDB  operator incompatibility**: The  layer was attempting to use  to add comments, which is not directly supported by PostgreSQL. The fix involved fetching the existing comments array, appending the new comment, and then using a  operation to update the entire array. This was implemented in .
2.  ** data type mismatch**: The  field for comments was stored as an ISO-formatted string in PostgreSQL but was expected as a  object by the  helper function in the backend, leading to  and 500 errors during comment fetching.
3.  **Duplicate API endpoints**: A duplicate comment endpoint in  caused unpredictable behavior, which was resolved by commenting it out.
4.  **Frontend/Backend field inconsistencies**: Numerous issues with API endpoints, parameter names ( vs ), and count field names ( vs ) in  were addressed in earlier stages to ensure proper communication.

The very last action taken was to apply a robust fix to the  function in , as suggested by the user, to correctly parse string  values into  objects and ensure timezone awareness. This was done after a previous attempt to fix  caused a regression (feed disappeared) and had to be reverted. The backend was successfully restarted after this final  fix.

Verify that comment fetching and adding functionality now works correctly on the Post Detail Page without any errors.
