The AI engineer successfully guided the user through an iterative development process for a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The work focused heavily on UI/UX alignment with Instagram-style features, resolving numerous image-related issues (upload, display, pathing), implementing robust user profile management (including a username cooldown), and building a comprehensive comment, story, and share system.

Key challenges included debugging misconfigured API routes (e.g., ), ensuring consistent data handling (FormData vs. JSON, optional fields), and fixing authentication-related data fetching issues that led to blank UI elements. The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic approach to debugging, often using backend logs and frontend console outputs, and applying fixes to both frontend and backend as needed. The final unresolved issue centers around the Users tab in the search functionality not displaying results for a known user.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested to start the web application and provide a preview URL. Following this, the core product requirements evolved incrementally, focusing on transforming an existing Instagram-style dating and social web application (LuvHive) into a more feature-rich and visually consistent platform.

Key feature requests and issues addressed:
1.  **UI/UX Alignment**: Reduce the size of Stories and Mystery sections, add notification bell and search icons to the header, ensure clickable hashtags. Later, a complete Instagram-style stories layout was requested, where the user's DP acts as Add Story and other stories appear as horizontal circles, with the Mystery button relocated to the top alongside other navigation.
2.  **Notifications**: Implement a notification system for likes, comments, and follow requests via the notification bell icon.
3.  **Image Handling**: Fix various issues with image display across the application, including:
    *   Posted images not showing.
    *   User Display Pictures (DPs) not showing in profiles or stories.
    *   Photo post text appearing instead of images for caption-less posts.
    *   Ensure all images (posts, profiles, stories) are served and displayed correctly with proper URL construction.
4.  **Profile Management**:
    *   Fix Edit Profile page not opening due to authentication issues.
    *   Ensure DP and bio update and display correctly in My Profile page.
    *   Implement a 15-day cooling period for username changes.
    *   Make profile images visible in posts and clickable to navigate to user profiles, including handling private accounts.
    *   Remove a redirecting message when navigating to one's own profile.
5.  **Story Functionality**:
    *   Fix story creation issues (e.g., 422 errors, logger import).
    *   Ensure clicking a story circle opens the story viewer (not create story).
    *   Resolve broken story images within the viewer.
    *   Fix the story viewer's close button and make navigation arrows clearly visible.
6.  **Comment System**: Implement a full Instagram-style comment system with:
    *   A modal interface to view and add comments.
    *   The ability to like comments (heart icon, visual feedback for likes).
    *   Display DPs in comments.
    *   Allow clicking on usernames to open profiles.
7.  **Share Functionality**: Implement a working share button with Web Share API fallback and a user-friendly modal.
8.  **Search Functionality**:
    *   Fix the search button to navigate to the search page.
    *   Ensure search results (users, posts) are displayed correctly, including profile and post images.
    *   Resolve No users found issues even when users exist.
    *   Fix a critical  URL doubling bug.
    *   Ensure posts include  data for search display.

The current state of the product, following these changes, includes a front-end with Instagram-like story circles, notification/search icons, functional post sharing, and a robust comment system. Profile editing and display are largely fixed, and post image display is working. The search functionality is mostly resolved, though the Users tab issue persists.

<pending_tasks>
-   The Users tab in the search results is still showing No users found despite posts being visible and the user existing, indicating a potential issue in how search results are filtered or displayed for users.
-   The AI engineer has not yet fixed post creation to automatically save  for new posts, though existing posts have been updated.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a persistent issue where the Users tab in the search functionality (on  page) was still displaying No users found for the 'Luvsociety' account, even after verifying that the user and their posts exist and are returned by the backend API. Profile pictures (DPs) were also not visible in the search results.

The previous actions taken were:
1.  **Fixed  storage**: Identified that newly created posts were not saving the  of the author. The AI engineer ran a MongoDB script to update existing posts with the correct .
    
2.  **Fixed post creation**: Modified  to ensure  is saved automatically when a new post is created.
    
3.  **Verified data**: Confirmed that a sample post in the database now correctly includes the  field.

The current state is that post images are now visible in the search results, and  is being stored with new posts and has been backfilled for existing ones. However, the Users tab on the search page still reports No users found and profile pictures are not visible for users in the search results. The AI engineer is in the process of debugging why the users are not being returned in the search results, specifically checking backend logs related to user search queries.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Analyze backend logs for  queries related to users to identify why user data isn't being returned or processed correctly for the Users tab.
