The AI engineer's work involved extensive debugging and refactoring for a social dating app, addressing critical issues from UI rendering to data handling. Initial problems included a non-functional About this account dialog, resolved by replacing a custom modal with a Radix Dialog component and correctly placing it. Subsequent efforts focused on persistent post-loading failures due to ID mismatches, strict backend filters, 500 errors from  field types, and broken images caused by URL prefix discrepancies. The engineer implemented robust media URL resolution, prioritized Telegram proxy handling, unified media helpers, and corrected environment variable usage. Privacy logic for private profiles was also tightened. The latest task involves fixing missing follow-back notifications after request acceptance.

The application is an MVP dating app with core features like LuvHive Verified badges, Founder Badge, dynamic profile picture updates, auto-refreshing feeds, and infinite scroll for posts. The AI engineer was tasked with resolving several critical issues to enhance user experience:

1.  **About this account Dialog:** This dialog, accessible from a user's profile, was not appearing or functioning correctly due to CSS/rendering conflicts. It needed to display join date, country, and verification pathway.
2.  **Profile Picture Display:** Profile pictures were not reliably displaying after registration, often requiring re-upload.
3.  **Edit Profile Functionality:** This feature was intermittently failing, linked to  issues or incorrect state updates.
4.  **User  field:** Needed to be integrated into registration and profile editing flows.
5.  **Invalid token Errors:** Users experienced authentication issues post-registration, blocking access to features like Mystery Match and Search until re-login.
6.  ** Status:** The verification status was not correctly reflected post-registration.
7.  **Posts Loading and Display:** Public profiles were not showing posts, or images appeared broken, due to:
    *   Incorrect user ID (username vs. UUID) used in API calls for posts.
    *   Backend post filtering ( instead of ).
    *   500 Internal Server Errors from backend due to  type handling and missing  fields.
    *   Frontend/backend URL prefix mismatch ( vs. ) for static files.
    *   Improper handling of Telegram-hosted media using  without proxy.
    *   Error checking profile (401) on  due to missing authentication tokens in API calls.
8.  **Private Profile Post Visibility:** Posts on private profiles were visible to followers, requiring stricter privacy rules.
9.  **Follow Notification and Follow back Button:** After accepting a follow request, the user who initiated the follow does not receive a notification with a Follow back button.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a wide array of issues related to media loading, URL resolution, and profile display. Key efforts included:

1.  **Unified Media Handling:** A new utility file () was created with  and  to standardize how media URLs are processed.  now prioritizes proxying Telegram-hosted media () and falls back to  or , while  ensures correct  prefixes and  prepending. This involved updating , , , , and  to use these new helpers, removing redundant local helper functions.
2.  **Backend Media URL Correction:**  was updated so  and  store media URLs with the correct  prefix. The   function was also refined to handle  field type variations, ensure correct  filtering, and dynamically provide Telegram proxy URLs.
3.  **Environment Configuration Fix:** The  in  was adjusted to resolve cross-domain image loading issues.
4.  **Privacy Enhancement:** The  logic was updated to rigorously hide posts on private profiles from all non-owners.
5.  **UX Improvements:** Removed unnecessary alerts in  and , allowing direct navigation to profiles.
6.  **Fixing TypeError:** Resolved a  in  related to incorrect  access by switching to .

The last user feedback (Chat Message 478) has highlighted a new issue: **after a user accepts a follow request, the initiator of the request does not receive a notification like Luvsociety started following you with an accompanying Follow back button.** The AI engineer has acknowledged this and is about to investigate the relevant backend and frontend code for the notification and follow system.
