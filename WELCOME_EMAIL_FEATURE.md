# Update to any color in the HTML template
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR1, #YOUR_COLOR2);
```

- Update tips and messaging
- Modify CTA button text/link

### Change Sender Name
```python
from_email="no-reply@luvhive.net"  # Current
from_email="welcome@luvhive.net"   # Alternative
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify SendGrid status: https://status.sendgrid.com/
3. Check logs: `tail -50 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep welcome`
4. Verify email address in SendGrid activity feed

### Email Sends but Looks Broken
- Some email clients don't support CSS
- Plain text version will be shown
- This is expected behavior

### Delivery Delays
- SendGrid typically delivers in 1-5 seconds
- Gmail may take longer (up to 5 minutes)
- Check SendGrid activity feed for delivery status
