- password_hash ‚úì
- age ‚úì
- gender ‚úì
- country ‚úì
- city ‚úì
- interests ‚úì

**Optional Fields:**

**Auto-set Fields:**
- emailVerified: true (auto-verified)
- phoneVerified: true if mobile provided
- violationsCount: 0
- location: {"city": city, "country": country}

## PROFILE COMPLETENESS CHECKS (INCONSISTENT!)

### Endpoint 1: `/verification/status` (Line 2317-2323)
```python
profile_complete = all([
    current_user.fullName,      # ‚úì Has during registration
    current_user.bio,           # ‚ùå NOT required during registration
    current_user.profileImage,  # ‚ùå Optional during registration
    current_user.gender,        # ‚úì Has during registration
    current_user.age            # ‚úì Has during registration
])
```

**Missing from this check:**
- ‚ùå Location (city/country) - even though it's REQUIRED during registration!

---

### Endpoint 2: `/auth/verification-status` (Line 2217)
```python
"completeProfile": {
    "met": has_bio and has_profile_pic and has_location,
    "description": "Complete profile (bio, photo, location)"
}
```

**Checks:**
- bio
- profile photo
- location (city OR country)

---

## THE ISSUE USER IS EXPERIENCING

**What happened:**
1. User registered successfully (provided all required fields in Step 1 & 2)
2. Profile photo was OPTIONAL, so user might have skipped it
3. Bio was NOT asked during registration (defaults to "")
4. When user added bio later, profile showed as "complete"

**Why it showed complete after adding bio:**
- Endpoint `/verification/status` checks: fullName + bio + profileImage + gender + age
- After adding bio, all these fields became truthy
- But this endpoint DOESN'T check location (even though it was provided!)
- And it DOES check profileImage (which might be empty string)

**The inconsistency:**
- Registration REQUIRES: city + country (location)
- Registration OPTIONAL: profile photo, bio
- Verification CHECK 1: Requires bio + photo + location
- Verification CHECK 2: Requires bio + photo, but NOT location

## RECOMMENDATION

**Option 1: Make Bio & Photo Required During Registration**
- Add bio textarea in Step 2
- Make profile photo required (not optional)
- This ensures users complete profile during signup

**Option 2: Fix Verification Logic to Match Registration**
Since location IS required during registration:
```python
profile_complete = all([
    current_user.fullName,      # ‚úì Required in registration
    current_user.gender,        # ‚úì Required in registration
    current_user.age,           # ‚úì Required in registration
    current_user.city or current_user.country,  # ‚úì Required in registration
    current_user.bio,           # Add as OPTIONAL or required
    current_user.profileImage   # Add as OPTIONAL or required
])
```

**Option 3: Make Profile Completion Separate from Registration**
- Let users register with basic info only
- Show "Complete Your Profile" banner with progress bar
- Incentivize profile completion (e.g., "90% complete - add bio to unlock features")

## CURRENT STATE SUMMARY

‚úÖ **Registration requires:** Name, Username, Email/Phone, Password, Age, Gender, City, Country, Interests, Personality Quiz

‚ùå **Registration does NOT require:** Bio, Profile Photo

‚ö†Ô∏è **Verification checks are inconsistent:**
- One endpoint checks bio + photo + location
- Another checks bio + photo (but NOT location)

üéØ **User's experience:** Adding bio made profile "complete" because verification logic doesn't properly validate all fields
